# anypic

(needs [the groff template
here](https://github.com/teoric/pandoc-templates) and the [lua filter
`image-ms.lua` from here](https://github.com/teoric/pandoc-filters) 

- [anypic.tmac](anypic.tmac) contains `.ANYPIC`, a groff macro for
  picture integration with Pandoc; works with the PostScript and PDF
  devices, and also some wrappers around tables.
- [s-heading-space.tmac](s-heading-space.tmac) contains some spacing
  modifications for `ms` headings, which better suit my taste.
